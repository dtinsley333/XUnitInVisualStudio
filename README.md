# XUnitInVisualStudio
Very simple xunit testing example. There are several tests a few are purposely failing. Fix them as a way to understand how to build 
and modify tests. 


##Prerequistes 
Will you need Visual Studio 2015 with the .NET SDK installed

##Steps To Run
1. Clone then open the solution file (.sln) file in Visual Studio
2. Rebuild the app and restore packages if needed. 
3. In order to run the tests, go to the menu/test/
windows/test explorer.
4. Once the test explorer window is open click "run all".
5. You will see several green(passing) tests and a couple of broken (red) tests.
6. Fix the broken tests and see if you can get them to pass, they are easy fixes.
